# Split-Flap Clock
The project aims to design and build a split flap display, an electromechanical display system that can be used for various applications, including digital clocks, departure boards, and information displays (refer to video linked in footnote). Split flap displays are known for their nostalgic and eye-catching aesthetics, making them a unique and engaging choice for this microprocessor project.

In this final project, we use the split flap displays to create a real-time clock. Our split-flap clock will has four displays, each with 40 flaps (for 10 single digit numbers, 0-9,  the 26 letters of the alphabet, A-Z, special characters, !/?/+, and a blank home state flap). Our clock displays the time in a 24-hour format (military time) and in the form "hour hour : minute minute". 

An additioanl feature of this project is the addition of an auxillary LED display that dynamically shows a sun or moon emoji to represent the time of day.
