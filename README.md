# Project Description
The project aims to design and build a split flap display, an electromechanical display system that can be used for various applications, including digital clocks, departure boards, and information displays (refer to video linked in footnote). Split flap displays are known for their nostalgic and eye-catching aesthetics, making them a unique and engaging choice for this microprocessor project.

# Project Overview
For our final project we will use the split flap displays to create a real-time clock. Our split-flap clock will have four displays, each with 40 flaps (for 10 single digit numbers, 0-9,  the 26 letters of the alphabet, A-Z, special characters, !/?/+, and a blank home state flap). By the end of this project, we want to display real-time, so our clock should be able to display times from 12:00 to 11:59, specifically in the format of hh:mm. Additionally, we will continuously show an emoji that represents the time of day using an LED display. The riskiest part of this project is creating the actual split flaps, as we are creating them from scratch using a laser cutter instead of buying them.
